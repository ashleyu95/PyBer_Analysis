# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
#### The purpose of this analysis is to sort the ride-sharing data differs by city type and plot a line graph. This will help analyze how the data of ride-sharing differ basd on the city type and use them for decision making on PyBer. 

## Results
### The ride-sharing data includes the total rides, total dricers, and total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. The city types include rural, suburban, and urban. From our summary data, we can see the rural area has the least in total rides, total drivers, and total fares, whereas the urban area has the most. However, looking at the average fare per ride and per driver, we can see that the rural are have a higher amount of fare than the urban area. We can get similar results by looking at the line graph. We can see that the urban line for weekly fares is always above the suburban and rural line. Also, we can get observe that there are some fluctuation over the weeks, however, there are no dramatic increase or decrease. The three lines are roughtly steady throughout the first quarter of 2019.

## Summary
### Recommendations 
- From the results of our analysis, we can see that the average fare per ride is higher in rural areas. This could be because the length of the ride since the cities are more wide spread in rural areas. Thus, before making any further decision, one should take a look at the average length (or distance) per ride. 
- The ride-sharing data sohws that people who live in the rural cities or areas ride less with PyBer. There might be several reasons for such behavior, for example, the lack of ride drivers. We should look deeper into the reasons and luanch plans to increase usage in rural cities. 
- From the line graph, we can observe that there is a small peak for the weekly amount of fares right before the month of March in all three city types. We can look into why was there an increase in ride-sharing.
